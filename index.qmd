# Welcome

Welcome to our **Lab Learning Sessions** website!

This is a series of interactive tutorials, designed to help us:
- Review core statistical and machine learning methods,
- Practice reproducible analysis in R/Julia/Python,
- Build shared conceptual and technical skills as a team.

Each session is built as a **Quarto notebook**, mixing:

- üìñ *Concepts & equations*
- üíª *Live code examples*
- üìä *Visualizations*
- üó£Ô∏è *Discussion prompts*

---

# How to Use

- Navigate through the **Sessions** tab in the menu.
- Code is **folded by default** ‚Äì click *Code* to expand and run interactively.
- All datasets are toy examples, designed to run quickly.

::: callout-tip
Clone the repository and run `quarto preview` locally if you want to experiment with the code.

# Sessions Overview

Here‚Äôs the roadmap for our first set of sessions:

1. **[Session 1: PCA, PCR, and PLS](sessions/01-pca-pcr-pls.qmd)**
   Dimensionality reduction, supervised vs unsupervised components.

(More topics to come, shaped by lab interest!)
